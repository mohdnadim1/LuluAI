## Integration with Frameworks

### Hugging Face Transformers

LuluAI is fully compatible with the Hugging Face ecosystem. Load the model using the following code:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load LuluAI
model_name = "yourusername/luluai"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Generate text
inputs = tokenizer("Hello, how can I assist you today?", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### ModelScope

To use LuluAI with ModelScope:

```python
from modelscope.pipelines import pipeline
from modelscope.utils.constant import Tasks

p = pipeline(task=Tasks.text_generation, model='yourusername/luluai')
result = p("Tell me about LuluAI.")
print(result)
```

### Ollama

Install Ollama:

```bash
brew install ollama-cli
```

Run the LuluAI model:

```bash
ollama run luluai
```

## Plugins

Extend LuluAI with plugins for specific use cases. Example:

### Custom Calculator Plugin

```python
from luluai_plugins import PluginManager

class CalculatorPlugin:
    def process(self, input_text):
        try:
            result = eval(input_text)
            return f"The result is {result}."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {e}"

plugin_manager = PluginManager()
plugin_manager.register_plugin("calculator", CalculatorPlugin())
```

Use the plugin:

```python
response = plugin_manager.run_plugin("calculator", "2 + 2")
print(response)  # Output: The result is 4.
```
